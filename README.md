# Assignment6
This is the repository for Assignment 6 for I310

## The goal of your project
The goal of this project was to analyse the record breaking 73 home run season that broke the season record and still holds it to this day. 

## Links to any relevant API documentation
I had to code most of this code out by myself but I did get the data from Baseball Reference

## The license of your data and any source data
https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=bondsba01&t=b&year=2001 

## A data type and description for each attribute in your data
All of the headers are Strings and all of the numbers are string data but in the analysis I changed them into integer data.

## Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection
There is a potential issue with the fairness that Barry had throughout his career. All of his numbers have been discredited because of his steroid scandal and it has barred him from the Hall Of Fame. The accuracy however is very accurate because baseball reference is the gold standard for baseball statistics.
